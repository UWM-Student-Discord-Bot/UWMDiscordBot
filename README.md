# SETUP
Welcome to the UWM Discord Bot project,  I'm sure this is the first time most of you have actually used github and contributed to a project, so we'll go over a few things.

First a few rules to note:
1. The master branch should ALWAYS BUILD AND BE DEPLOYABLE WITH NO ERRORS.
2. The develop branch should ALWAYS BUILD.
3. NEVER force push to develop or master.
4. Only push into your own branch unless you know what you're doing.

Alright now to begin we are going to create ourselves our own branch.  For those of you who don't know, a branch simply a secondary code base to reduce the clutter of everyone pushing to one single codebase. You can have as many branches as you want on a project and these will all record their own history of pushes.

Now you're probably asking, "How do I create a branch"...  First navigate over to <a href="https://github.com/UWM-Student-Discord-Bot/UWMDiscordBot">UWMDiscordBot</a>.  Then click on
the branch button (It usually displays "master"), and switch it to develop. Then enter your name into "Find or create branch" text field, and then create your branch.  A screenshot below
to help out.

As you can see in the screenshot, I am creating a branch from "develop" and not master.  Why is this?  We want the most update to date code base we can get, and master is only for
deploying, not pushing new changes.  DO NOT CREATE YOUR BRANCH FROM "master".

YOU HAVE NOW SUCCESSFULLY CREATED YOUR OWN BRANCH FROM THE MOST RECENT CODE BASE :D.

Now that you have your branch we are going to clone it.  Most of you will use your IDE to clone this branch, instructions for <a href="">IntelliJ</a> and <a href="">Eclipse</a>.  Those of you who do not use those two IDEs you'll either have to figure it out, or you can use the git command line (My personal favorite).

The only command you need is... "git clone [url]", execute this command in the directory you want the files copied to.

Now you're all set to go editing and adding  code as you want.  One thing to note is that when opening the project for the first time I recommend making your <b>OWN</b> package for all your code to go into.  See [QUICKSTART](QUICKSTART) for how to get started quickly, and see [PUSHING CHANGES](PUSHING-CHANGES) to learn how to push your changes correctly.
